# Vigenere Cipher

The cipher is a modified version of Caesar cipher where it uses an *tabula recta* - an table generate by many
characters shifts in the alphabet - serving as a guide to encrypt the message using its, and keyword, indexes.

## Tabula Recta

*Tabula Recta* is the table used as a guide to encryption or decryption of the message using its keyword.
It's generated by shifting the alphabet letters, exchangin their positions just like the demonstration below:

|   #   | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |

## Keyword

Used to help on encryption and decryption of the message. They both need to have the same length (keyword and message), so,
in case those don't match, the keyword needs to be adjusted. In case of a keyword with a lesser length than the message, just
repeat the keyword until it fits the necessary length. e. g.:

Message is `ATTACKATDAWN` and it has twelve characters.
Keyword is `LEMON` and it has five characters.

So, keyword just needs to fit twelve characters repeating its content. In this case, the new keyword would be `LEMONLEMONLE`.

## Encrypting message

For encryption, it needs to iterate over the keyword and the message using the same index, getting their characters and using
them as rows and columns, respectively, in the *tabula recta* to get the encrypted letter.

Using the same example as in the [keyword](#keyword) section, we have:

* fisrt letter of the treated key, `L`, with the first letter of the message, `A` give us `L`;
* second letter of the treated key, `E`, with the second letter of the message, `T`, give us `X`.

So on, and so forth until we get `LXFOPVEFRNHR`.

## Decrypting message

For decryption the logic is just a little different. It need to use the *tabula recta* still, but in a different manner.
Let's take our former message and key for the example. We already know that the encrytion generates the hash `LXFOPVEFRNHR`
so, iterating over the key, we use its letters to get rows in the *tabula recta*. Those rows would be the shifted alphabet for
the key letters we are using, so we just need to get their respective *column* to find the original letter.

Following this logic, we have:

* row of the first key letter `L` with the value as the first hash letter `L`, giving us the column `A`;
* row of the second key letter `E` with the value as the second hash letter `X`, giving us the column `T`;

So on and so forth until we have our original message, `ATTACKATDAWN`.
